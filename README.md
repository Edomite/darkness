# Fit To Print

## A news app built without any libraries or frameworks to see how much functionality can be built in vanilla Javascript
## Using APIs from The Guardian and the New York Times newspapers
*Javascript - DOM Manipulation - Fetch - Async/Await - CSS*

### An overview of the homepage and the top stories page: the homepage features both newspapers' most read articles of the moment
![App Overview]()

### Can tweet any of the articles from your personal Twitter account
![Tweet Articles]()

### The NYT API has a 'per-facet' property which lists names of people mentioned in its articles - clicking on them searches both the NYT and the Guardian for that name
![App PerFacet Search]()

### Users can search both APIs with the same keyword or name at the same time
![App Search]()

### The gallery shows the newspapers' 20 most popular articles - clicking on one will open the article in a new tab

#### **Biggest obstacle:** the NYT API 

Post-MVP plans:
1. Responsive design - want to make the layout work well on all screen sizes and browsers - currently it looks best in Chrome and sizes +900px
1. Modular Programming - look at ways to refactor the code to make it more readable, shorter and reusable
